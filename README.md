# annoying-game
An annoying text game I made to learn a bit of python

Adventure_game.py
This is a very simple text adventure style game that I made with if statements and functions to learn if statements and functions. It runs in the console/terminal

An_Annoying_Game.py
requires tkinter to run in the console
This is the adventure game re-written to work in a tkinter GUI

An_Annoying_Game.exe
This is the tkinter version as a .exe converted using auto-py-to-exe
